            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Posted on <span class="color">27 July 2023</span> (can be any description)</p>
            <div class="p1">
        <p>Have you heard the rumor? It's school mystery number one-The Three Clock keepers. There's a big, big old clock somewhere
            in the school. That clock is time itself-the time that flows through the school. If you move the hands of that clock,
            the school's time is yours to command. But you see.....There are guards watching over the big clock. They're the three
            clock keepers who represent past, present, and future. If anyone touches the clock without their permission...The three
            clock keepers will steal the time from that person's life!</p>
            
          <p>The three clock keepers are the first of the Seven Mysteries in a manga known as 'Jibaku no Shounen Hanako-kun'.
         It is the fourth school mystery to be introduced in the series.
         They are the first school mystery to be seen independently outside
          of their boundary and unrelated to their rumor. The clock keepers are those who oversees the time aspect of Kamome Academy,
          a school, the are able to control time and hold power because of the Big Clock at the Sealed Auditorium, which is only opened 
          during school festivals. If the Clock were to be destroyed, time would be paused, the clock keepers boundary 
          would open, and the person who broke the clock is able
          to control the time. We are able to see an example of this in chapter 107 of the manga.
         Unlike the other school mysteries, the clock keepers consist of three members
          â€” Kako(old one), Mirai(small one) and Akane(the ginger). They represent past, present and future. </p>

            <p> Unlike Mirai and Kako, Akane is tricked into forming a contract with the clock keepers 
            after falling for a scheme they orchestrated.
             He is now currently in a 6-year-long contract with them, until his graduation.
             The clock keepers are able to control time. 
             Kako and Mirai have the ability to turn back and move time forward respectively. As a contractor,
            Akane can stop time for five minutes up to three times a day.
            He notes that if he goes an entire school day without any incidents,
            he is able to use it for fifteen minutes at a time.

            <div class="article2">
            <p> In the latest chapters of Jibaku no Shounen, we see the appearance of the clockkeepers.In chapter
                111, it is stated that the no.1 Clock Keepers lowest layer of their boundary is covered in snow. They had
                once lived in a foreign town and spoke a foreign language. This place is also the innermost reaches of a boundary
                vividly reflect a school mysteries orgins so it is hinted by Akane that Mirai and Kako once lived in a snowy place.

                <p>Words meant to be defined are placed here.</p>
            </aside>

            <p>Mirai. in English, Mirai means"future". Kako. in English, Kako means"past". Mirai and Kako don't actually have names,
                so when Akane first joined the Clock Keepers these were the names he gave the two of them. The reason why Akane had
                named them Mirai and Kako is because Mirai controls the future, whereas Kako controls the past.

            <p>In conclusion, the three clock keepers are cool and they are my favorite characters in the manga even thought
                they are only side characters.</p>
